fix unicode support
    http://docs.python.org/howto/unicode.html
    use utf8 for parsing
    mapped classes should return a unicode object for str()
    OR: remove all unicode from everything?
    
sms and non-ascii chars? (perhaps covered by unicode fix)

revert commit [] regarding PA dump excluding zero'd galaxies when fixed
alliances should be reactivated if possible, don't always create new ones

loadable paramre platform update: multiple execute methods

rewrite CLI

rewrite Connection.write and Action.write to use detached threaded system

Reimplement Robocop (threaded?)
    scan requests (!request)
    scans parsed (!scans)

Hooks.scans.request
    !request cancel id
    request.dists
        fill in from scan requests ("ellonweb informs that atleast n dists are needed")
        fill in from intel
        fill in from Hooks.scans.blocked
