loadable paramre platform update: multiple execute methods

rewrite CLI

rewrite Connection.write and Action.write to use detached threaded system

Reimplement Robocop
    server.bind(("127.0.0.1",port))
    select.select([sock.file.fileno(), server.fileno()],[],[],330)
    check returned fileno to match, then .readline() or .accept()
    retain server on reboot
    use the same parser or sub class Action?
    base64 messages?
    seperate callback system or integrated?
    
    after accepting a socket request, add it to the list of sockets
    select on all sockets: read appropriate socket
    if read == "", socket class handles Reboot or removing from list?
    
    scan requests (!request)
    scans parsed (!scans)

Hooks.scans.request
    this can not be finished until robocop is reimplemented
    also would be nice to have platform update done
    !request cancel id
    request.dists
        fill in from scan requests ("ellonweb informs that atleast n dists are needed")
        fill in from intel
        fill in from Hooks.scans.blocked
