loadable paramre platform update: multiple execute methods

rewrite CLI

rewrite Connection.write and Action.write to use detached threaded system

Reimplement Robocop (threaded?)
    scan requests (!request)
    scans parsed (!scans)

Hooks.scans.request
    this can not be finished until robocop is reimplemented
    also would be nice to have platform update done
    !request cancel id
    request.dists
        fill in from scan requests ("ellonweb informs that atleast n dists are needed")
        fill in from intel
        fill in from Hooks.scans.blocked
